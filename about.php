  <strong>OWNii</strong> is an acronym for "<strong>O</strong>ptical <strong>W</strong>ireless <strong>N</strong>etwork <strong>I</strong>nternet <strong>I</strong>nfrastructure." It is based on the 4th industrial revolutionary, disruptive, LiFi technology. LiFi, meaning "Light Fidelity" is the brainchild of Harold Haas et al and pureLiFi, Ltd. It expands the spectrum bands for more devices in the IoT era to go online without jamming the ecosystem. It is safer, healthier and with far more advantages than the alternative of small cell towers electromagnetically transmitting within short distances of each other in our communities, that is, the current technology behind wireless communication more commonly known as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.  LiFi technology significantly increases speed, security, and density.
  </p>
  <p>
  LiFi technology can provide visible light as well as data transfer. Hence, these capabilities significantly enhance the spectrum of applications for use in hospitals, airplanes, trains, underground, underwater, etc. As we grow in IoT, it is vitally critical that we build this infrastructure to support our new ecosystem adopting the LiFi applications that would revolutionize the wireless communications and security landscape. Besides, when coupled with the applications of environmentally friendly, green sustainable eco-system technologies, products, and services, our OWNii Ecosystem would be the leading example of energy efficient, significant reduction in carbon footprint, sustainable and scalable infrastructure across the globe.  And the OWNii cryptocurrency is the "World's First Revolutionary Utility, Asset-Based, Smart Blockchain, LiFi Technology Global New Infrastructure Digital Token" to launch this massive global process.
  </p>
  <p>
  Together with San Victus Pte Ltd, as one of the founders of OWNii crypto-token, Global Greenology, a privately owned global manufacturing and design company specializing in environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, sustainable building solutions, developed this decentralized, asset-based, virtual, OWNii smart blockchain token for Li-Fi technology and green sustainable technologies implementation. The Founders were the first to successfully install LiFi technology in a residential home environment in the USA 2017 and a commercial environment in Germany in 2018. The first LiFi technology system was installed in a commercial office in San Jose, CA 2020. Also, it was the first along with its solution partner, Power Community Development Systems, Inc. (PCDSI) to have published an independent, non-partisan full research study authored by Andre Proano, an Electrical & Electronics Communication Engineering Major as his thesis at the University of Ecuador 2018. With much to be done and other products and services in development to bring this disruptive technology to end-users and to further expand the platform, the Founders are looking for like-minded, forward thinking investors to contribute to this imperative new infrastructure ecosystem globally.

  <p>
  Currently, the primary platform players, pureLiFi (UK), TruLiFi by Signify, and OLEDComm manufactures and distributes the devices needed to stream communication through existing LED and infrared lights. As it is known, nothing moves faster than the speed of light. These companies are working diligently from the top-down to integrate the LiFi technology in all conceivable communication networks from mobile phones, laptops, personal computers, hospital instrumentations, airplanes, trains, and a host of IoT devices. Equally, there must be a bottom-up approach to educate and orchestrate practical use by the people who will be using such devices which is OWNii Energy's focus. Amazingly, when the top-down and the bottom-up implementations merge for full-scale adoption of this revolutionary, disruptive new LiFi technology, it will be phenomenal!
  </p>
  <!-- <p>
  OWNii Energy was conceived to oversee, develop, and design the physical infrastructure necessary to expand LiFi in the United States, globally and crucially to Tribal reservations, rural areas and developing countries abroad who would not otherwise have access to the internet due to Wi-Fi limitations. The OWNii Coin will promote the creation of OWNii Ecosystem, a new internet infrastructure along with sustainable, energy efficient and green ecosystems in the United States and worldwide. It will also create numerous opportunities for employment, business ownership, and entrepreneurial endeavors selling equipment and services. As a matter of fact, all 3-primary LiFi product lines platforms from pureLiFi, TruLiFi by Signify, and OLEDComm can be purchased directly from our companies that address both the external and internal infrastructures. Additional valued-added products and services furthers augment our infrastructure portfolio to consumers for a seamless experience. Essentially, the potential multiple streams of revenues that OWNii token represents will bring unprecedented value. Once launched, the infrastructure will continue creating new technology, software, products, and services that will further complement and intrinsically make the OWNii token valuable.

  The OWNii utility, asset-based, digital token, and the resulting capital it generates allows OWNii Energy the ability to build the OWNii Ecosystem and effectively provide the technologies to reach the end-users. Inclusively, it will provide resources to further enhance the manufacturing of the Li-Fi technology systems in the USA with PoE LED lighting, other smart devices in residential homes, commercial developments, retails, medical centers, hotels, schools, senior facilities and the vast IoT arrivals. At the same time under the OWNii Ecosystem, it will provide resources to implement green energy technologies, eco-friendly materials, waste treatment and other sustainable technologies, products, and services.  Many projects, services, and smart cities and communities are already underway for implementation and user-base expansion. <strong>Come partner with us!</strong>
