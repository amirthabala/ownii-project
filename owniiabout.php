                <p>The Founders, together with their affiliates and associates, are in collaboration to spearhead strategic plans for building smart green communities and townships in the USA, Malaysia and other countries leveraging on Light Fidelity (“Li-Fi”) technology based Optical Wireless Network Internet Infrastructure (“OWNii”) systems; for developing waste-to-energy (“WTE”) conversion projects based on plastic, tire and other waste recycling technologies; and manufacturing Clean Green Energy (“CGE”) generators using state of the art technology.</p>
                <br>
                <p>These strategic plans are focused on the strategic objectives of developing, building and operating green, sustainable, scalable and environmentally friendly communities, cities, green or renewable energy and infrastructure projects as part of the wider ecosystem.</p>
                <br>
                <p>By entering into a strategic partnership, the Founders will pioneer smart building technologies, Green Energy technologies and the OWNii System associated technology as well as all related technologies in the sustainable green domains. With a growing demand for OWNii System technology, the Founders are well positioned as the first to implement the infrastructure for the next internet green wave! Under the strategic plans, the Founders shall launch all these technologies and install Li-Fi based internet infrastructure in all of USA and the rest of the globe, in particular, in Asia.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With an extensive knowledge of blockchain based crypto-currency coupled with the domain knowledge of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) software algorithm and system implementation, as well as the Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) devices and integration expertise, the Founders shall also leverage on these expertise and knowledge to exploit these technologies and incorporate them seamlessly into the development of the smart communities, townships and cities, the OWNii system and the WTE and CGE Technologies based sustainable green or renewable energy projects, thus the realization of the Strategic Objectives and Strategic Targets of the entire OWNii Ecosystem.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The creation and launch of the OWNii Coin token as the crypto-currency is just part of the Strategic Initiative in terms of the capital funding under the Project, whereas the application of the Blockchain Technology, AI Solutions and IoT Solutions into these underlying projects are key differentiating components that are at the forefront of current technological advances.</p>
