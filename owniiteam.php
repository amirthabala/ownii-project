                    OWNii Energy was conceived to oversee, develop, and design the physical infrastructure necessary to expand LiFi in the United States, globally and crucially to Tribal reservations, rural areas and developing countries abroad who would not otherwise have access to the internet due to Wi-Fi limitations. The OWNii Coin will promote the creation of OWNii Ecosystem, a new internet infrastructure along with sustainable, energy efficient and green ecosystems in the United States and worldwide. It will also create numerous opportunities for employment, business ownership, and entrepreneurial endeavors selling equipment and services.

                As a matter of fact, all 3-primary LiFi product lines platforms from pureLiFi, TruLiFi by Signify, and OLEDComm can be purchased directly from our companies that address both the external and internal infrastructures. Additional valued-added products and services furthers augment our infrastructure portfolio to consumers for a seamless experience. Essentially, the potential multiple streams of revenues that OWNii token represents will bring unprecedented value. Once launched, the infrastructure will continue creating new technology, software, products, and services that will further complement and intrinsically make the OWNii token valuable.
