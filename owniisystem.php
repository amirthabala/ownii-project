                <p>OWNii means Optical Wireless Network Internet Infrastructure. It is a communications internet infrastructure network that is based on Optical Wireless Communications (OWC) technology instead of radiowave freqeuency based technologies such as Wi-Fi. This focuses on utilizing visible light to provide an inexpensive and efficient alternative medium of wireless communication. Currently, OWC is commonly used in infrared remote controls of air conditioners and televisions. OWC technology will significantly optimize the modern workplace. Video conferences, file sharing, intranet infrastructure can be scaled up with the appropriate data and voice transfer technologies and infrastructure and propagate over the internet.</p>

                <p>This means as part of the Strategic Initiatives, the infrastructure to undertake the development, oversight, the design of the physical infrastructure necessary to implement, systematically install, test, commission, operate and maintain Li-Fi technology and its applications, products and services into OWNii in the USA and developing nations abroad.</p>
                <br>
                <p>LED bulbs are an existing technology in the lighting arena that rely on the characteristics of light emitting diodes with LED drivers to produce light that have an overall lower energy consumption. And with LED transformers incorporated as part of the design, the reach and distance of coverage are greatly extended, increasing the lighting cone of illumination.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Li-Fi enabled LED bulbs incorporate the Li-Fi technology into the design of such LED bulbs to allow transmission of data transmission, and at speeds much higher than traditional Wi-Fi routers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With Li-Fi enabled LED bulbs as a core feature, the design of such devices into data transmission and receptor permits a range of IoT devices to be produced, such as modems and routers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>These not only serve the lighting for illumination purposes, but also provide the necessary mesh network for voice and data transmission after integrating infrared beams into the directional transmission designs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As such, by combining with data streaming, these can be applied and promoted to be used as smart lighting in cities whereby building lights and street lights can be connected to communicate wirelessly.</p>

                <p>The OWNii Ecosystem shall be developed to ensure that the development and design of the physical infrastructure necessary to implement Li-Fi Technology in the United States and abroad, with a special focus on developing countries, would be the testament of the successful applications of these technologies in creating sustainable green ecosystems to benefit mankind.</p>
                <br>
                <p>OWNii Ecosystem encompasses a significant cross-industry and sectors of deployment, from which the adoption of Blockchain Technology based solutions would greatly and significantly benefit from.</p>
